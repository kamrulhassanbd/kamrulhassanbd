# GIT (GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER)

 
GIT Workflow Diagram

GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER
VCS: VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
It will keep the code separately for each version.

v-1	: 100 lines --- > store (repo-1)
v-2	: 200 lines --- > store (repo-2)
v-3	: 300 lines --- > store (repo-3)

REPO: It is a folder where we store our code.
index.html: it is a basic file for every application

v1 --- > index.html
v2 --- > index.html
v3 --- > index.html 

INTRO:
Git is used to track the files.
It will maintain multiple versions of the same file.
It is platform-independent.
It is free and open-source.
They can handle larger projects efficiently.
It is 3rd generation of vcs.
It is written on c programming
It came on the year 2005

CVCS: CENTRALIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: SVN: It can store code on a single repo.

DVCS: DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: GIT: it can store code on Multiple repos.

ROLLBACK: Going back to the previous version of the application.

STAGES:
WORKING DIRECTORY: Where we write our source code.
STAGING AREA: We track files here.
REPOSITORY: Where we store tracked source code

WORKING WITH GIT:
Create an ec2 server:
mkdir swiggy
cd swiggy

yum install git -y [yum=pkg manager, install=action, git=pkg name -y=yes]
To check version 		: git -v
To install. git (local repo) 	: git init
To create file			: vim index.html (content is opt)
To check status			: git status
To track file			: git add index.html
To check status			: git status
To store file			: git commit -m "commit-1" index.html

Create a file -- > add -- > commit 

To show commits		: git log
To show last 2 commits	: git log -2
To show commits in single line: git log -2 –oneline
Show you the difference between your committed file and the current staged file.				: git diff  

=================================================
Use config to add your name and email:
$git config --global user.name “nameHere” 
$git config --global user.email “emailHere”

NOTE: this user and email will be replicated to new commits only.
Git show: Used to show the files which are attached to commits.
git log --oneline
git show commit_id

BRANCHES:
It is an individual line of development.
Developers write the code on branches.
Initially breaches we create on git.
After write source code on git, we push to GitHub.
Default branch is Master.
Note: When we do an initial commit the only default branch will be created.

Dev -- > Git (Movie’s branch) -- > code -- > GitHub

COMMANDS:
git branch				: to list the branches
git branch movies		: to create the branch movie
git checkout movies		: to switch blw the branches
git checkout -b dth		: to create and switch dth at same time
git branch -m old new		: to rename a branch
git branch -D recharge		: to delete a branch

NOTE: To recover the delete branch

PROCESS:
git branch movies
git checkout movies
touch movies{1..5}
git add movies*
git commit -m "dev-1" movies*

NOW PUSH THE CODE TO GITHUB:
create a repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/nayakdebasish091/paytm.git

PUSH: to send files form git to GitHub
local: .git & remote: paytm.git
git push origin movies
username:
password:

TOKEN GENERATION: 
account -- > settings -- >developer settings -- > PAT -- > Classic -- > Generate new token -- > classic -- > name: abcd -- > select 6 options -- > generate 

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

Note: it will be visible only once

create branch --> switch to branch --> files -- > add -- > commit -- > push


GIT PULL: It will get the branch from GitHub to git

git pull origin recharge
git checkout recharge

GIT IGNORE: It will not track the files which we want.
touch java{1..5}
vim .gitignore
j* -- > :wq
git status

you can’t see the files now 

GIT RESTORE: To untrack the tracked file
touch raham
git status
git add
git status
git restore --staged raham
git status

GET BACK THE DELETED FILE:
Note: we can restore only tracked files.
git reset 		 drops the changes staged into the index, but the working copy is left intact 
git reset –-hard 	 drops all the changes in the index and in the working copy
=================================================
MERGE:
Adding the files between one branch to another branch
git merge branch_name

REBASE:
Adding the files between one branch to another branch
git rebase branch_name
 MERGE VS REBASE:
MERGE	REBASE
Merge will show files.	Rebase will not show files.
Merge will not show branches.	Rebase will show branches.
Merge will show entire history.	Rebase will not.

STASH: to hide the files which are not committed.
Note: file need to be tracked but not committed

touch file2
git stash
git stash apply
git stash list
git stash clear
git stash pop (clears last stash)

==================================================================

MERGE CONFLICT:
When we try to merge 2 branches with same file and Different content Then conflict will raise.
So, we need to resolve the conflict manually

CHERRY-PICK: 
We can merge only specific files from one branch to another with the help of commit_id
git cherry-pick commit_id

SHOW:
To show the commits for a file
git show commit_id

git log --patch
git log --stat

REVERT: To undo the merging
git revert branch_name
git revert
git revert branch-1
